# MEGA MONKY BALL SHOOTER
an amazing game built with sdl, c++ and a lack of knowing better

**I PROMISE THE MONKEY WILL BE ADDED SOON**

## current state
ass

## roadmap
- add monkey
- add textures (make game look worse)
- microtransactions / in game currency
- delete your files if you lose
- nft integration (bring your own monkey)
- add actual gameplay

## how to make run
### linus
compile with `make` (shitty one-line makefile)
run with `./game`

### windows
you have to change some stuff in the includes i guess

### mac os
lol
